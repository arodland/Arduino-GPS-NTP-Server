* med_mean_filter is called "trimmed mean"
* Look into FLL and PLL and adjusting their relative contributions depending
  on how stable the clock is currently.
* Next cycle after fast slew, use the delta between the current and last PPS
  measurements (correcting for the fast slew amount) to adjust the freq
  directly instead of allowing the PLL to work.
* If GPS sync is lost (no serial or serial reports <3D fix) then the NTP
  "reference time" should stop counting -- this lets us keep reporting
  freerun time, while letting peers know that we're not fully synced anymore.
* We can/should also increase the "root dispersion" value in proportion to
  time spent free-running.
